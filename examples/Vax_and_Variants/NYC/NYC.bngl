#---
# About: 
#  - This model is intended to be consistent with the compartmental model
#    of Mallela et al. (2023), which describes COVID-19 transmission dynamics.
#  - The model is specified in terms of building blocks labeled
#    S, SV, E, A, I, V, H, R, and D.
#     - The building blocks represent distinct populations.
#     - Some of the populations have population features, which have
#       multiple possible values.

# S: susceptible population
#  comments:
#   - The entire population (less I0) is initially susceptible.
#  population features:
#   SD: non-pharmaceutical intervention (SD) adopted
#    comments:
#     - Persons in the S, E, A, I, and R compartments may
#       change their behavior to prevent disease transmission.
#    possible feature values:
#     - 0: none
#     - P: social distancing
#     - Q: quarantine or self-isolation
#     - M: mixing
#     - V: vaccination
#     comments:
#      - Persons in the SD~M state are mixing/socializing freely.
#        They do not take precautions to prevent disease transmission.
#      - Persons in the SD~P state take precautions to prevent
#        disease transmission.
#      - Persons in the SD~Q state are separated from susceptible persons.
#        They are incapable of transmitting disease.
#      - Persons in the SD~V state are vaccinated. V~0~1~2~3 tracks the
#        number of vaccine doses that a person has received.

# E: exposed population in the incubation period of disease progression
#  population features:
#   stage: incubation period stage
#    comments:
#     - The incubation period is divided into 5 stages.
#     - Exposed persons do not have symptoms
#       throughout the incubation period.
#     - Exposed persons are infectious except in the first stage
#       of the incubation period.
#    possible feature values:
#     - 1: 1st stage of the incubation period
#     - 2: 2nd stage of the incubation period
#     - 3: 3rd stage of the incubation period
#     - 4: 4th stage of the incubation period
#     - 5: 5th stage of the incubation period
#     comments:
#      - Exposed persons in the first stage of the incubation period
#        are ineligible for quarantine (because virus cannot be detected).
#   SD: non-pharmaceutical intervention (SD) adopted
#      possible feature values:
#     - 0: none
#     - P: social distancing
#     - Q: quarantine or self-isolation

# A: asymptomatic population
#  comments:
#   - Asymptomatic persons have passed through the incubation period.
#   - Asympotmatic persons are infectious.
#   - Asymptomatic persions will never develop symptoms.
#  population feature values:
#   SD: non-pharmaceutical intervention (SD) adopted
#    possible feature values:

# I: population with mild symptomatic disease
#  comments:
#   - Symptomatic persons are more likely to self-isolate than
#     pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic persons because of symptom awareness.
#  population features:
#    SD: non-pharmaceutical intervention (SD) adopted
#     possible feature values:
#      - 0: none
#      - P: social distancing

#  comments:
#   - Vaccinated person in the SD~M do not take precautions to prevent
#     disease transmission. This population is still at risk of infection.

# H: population with severe disease
#  comments:
#   - Persons with severe disease are in hospital or isolated at home.
